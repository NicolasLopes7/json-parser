# json parser
This is a simple parser made in Typescript, and tested with Vitest. ✨

## Steps
It has only two simple steps:
 - The Lexer
   - Split all the characters in tokens, and create literals in keywords.
 - The Parser
   - Creates an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with the tokens provided by the lexer
